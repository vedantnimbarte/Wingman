# Wingman Documentation Index

Welcome to Wingman's technical documentation. This index guides you to the right resource based on what you're trying to do.

## Getting Started

- **New to Wingman?** Start with the [README.md](../README.md) — what makes it
  different, install, and quick start.
- **Want the full feature list?** [FEATURES.md](FEATURES.md).
- **Looking for a subcommand?** [CLI.md](CLI.md), or `wingman --help`.
- **Configuring it?** [CONFIGURATION.md](CONFIGURATION.md) — every knob, env
  vars, permission modes, on-disk layout.
- **Which models/providers work?** [PROVIDERS.md](PROVIDERS.md).
- **Extending it?** [EXTENDING.md](EXTENDING.md) — hooks, slash commands,
  custom tools.

## Understanding Wingman

### Architecture & Design

- **[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)** — System overview, core crates, data flow diagrams, threading model, feature flags.
  - Best for: Understanding how components fit together, design decisions, module responsibilities.
  - Read this if: You're extending Wingman, debugging, or understanding the agent loop.

### Major Subsystems

- **[TREE-SITTER.md](TREE-SITTER.md)** — Language-aware parsing integration (Rust, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go).
  - Best for: Understanding semantic chunking, symbol extraction, code understanding.
  - Read this if: You're working with the RAG index, diff tools, or adding new languages.

- **[LSP.md](LSP.md)** — Language Server Protocol client: resolved go-to-definition, references, hover, diagnostics, rename, and LSP-backed verification receipts.
  - Best for: Understanding the `lsp_*` tools, server detection, and how diagnostics feed the turn gate.
  - Read this if: You want resolved (not name-matched) code intelligence, or you're wiring the verification gate.

- **[LEARNING-LOOP.md](LEARNING-LOOP.md)** — Self-improving mechanism (memories, skill stats, session recall, nudges).
  - Best for: Understanding how Wingman learns from sessions, persists across projects, and builds institutional knowledge.
  - Read this if: You're using memory features, skill extraction, or cross-project recall.

- **[HTTP-API.md](HTTP-API.md)** — The `wingman serve` HTTP/SSE API: one daemon over an allowlist of repos, bearer auth, a permission ceiling requests cannot raise, SSE streams, and `--remote` client mode.
  - Best for: driving Wingman from another machine, a phone, CI, or your own app.
  - Read this if: you want pilot runs steerable from anywhere, or a scriptable surface over the CLI.
  - Build order and design record: [HTTP-API-PLAN.md](HTTP-API-PLAN.md).

- **[WEB-UI.md](WEB-UI.md)** — The web control panel `wingman serve` hosts: a React app embedded in the binary, alongside the TUI rather than replacing it.
  - Best for: driving the board, runs, and config from a browser or a phone.
  - Read this if: you want the board, runs, config or a chat from a browser — or a binary is serving "the web UI was not built".
  - Build order and design record: [WEB-UI-PLAN.md](WEB-UI-PLAN.md).

- **[TOOLS.md](TOOLS.md)** — Reference for all 20+ built-in tools (file I/O, search, shell, semantic search, memory, skills, session management).
  - Best for: Complete tool signatures, behavior, permission requirements, error handling.
  - Read this if: You want to know what tools are available or how to use a specific tool.

### Pilot Mode & Roadmap

- **[PILOT-MODE.md](PILOT-MODE.md)** — The shipped `wingman pilot` surface: capability tiers, quick start, run artefacts, status.
  - Best for: Actually running multi-agent orchestration.
  - Read this if: You want a goal planned, worked in isolated worktrees, and converged into a PR.

- **[AUTONOMOUS-MODE.md](AUTONOMOUS-MODE.md)** — Design doc for multi-task agent orchestration, now shipped as **Pilot mode** (`wingman pilot`).
  - Best for: Understanding the vision, data model, architecture, TUI integration.
  - Read this if: You're using pilot mode, contributing to it, or interested in the roadmap.
  - See also: **Pilot mode** in [PILOT-MODE.md](PILOT-MODE.md) for the shipped command surface.

- **[BOARD.md](BOARD.md)** — `wingman board`: a persistent, multi-project kanban board over pilot runs. Cards are goals that outlive their runs; columns are derived from run state, never stored.
  - Best for: seeing what is planned, running, in review and done across every repo — with the agent, model, cost and logs behind each task.
  - Read this if: you want a backlog that survives runs, or you're implementing it.
  - Spec: [BOARD-SPEC.md](BOARD-SPEC.md). Build order and design record: [BOARD-PLAN.md](BOARD-PLAN.md). Status: **shipped** — in the terminal and in the panel ([WEB-UI.md](WEB-UI.md)).

- **[DIFFERENTIATION.md](DIFFERENTIATION.md)** — Differentiation roadmap (model routing, warm repo index, verification receipts, team memory).
  - Best for: Understanding how Wingman plans to beat Claude Code/Codex on speed, trust, and retention.
  - Read this if: You're prioritizing single-agent features or positioning the product.

### Adding a New Tool

1. Create a new file in `crates/wingman-tools/src/builtin/<tool_name>.rs`.
2. Implement the `Tool` trait (`spec()` and `run()`).
3. Register in `crates/wingman-tools/src/registry.rs`.
4. Update **[TOOLS.md](TOOLS.md)** with the tool signature and examples.

### Adding Support for a Language

1. Update `crates/wingman-ts/Cargo.toml` — add grammar crate.
2. Update `crates/wingman-ts/src/lang.rs` — add Language variant, detection.
3. Update `crates/wingman-ts/src/parse.rs` — add parser initialization.
4. Update **[TREE-SITTER.md](TREE-SITTER.md)** with the new language.

## Feature Flags

Wingman uses feature flags to reduce build time and dependencies for builds that don't need certain subsystems.

```bash
# Build with all features (default)
cargo build --release

# Build without tree-sitter (faster, but no language parsing)
cargo build --release --no-default-features -p wingman-ts

# Build without embeddings (uses hash fallback for RAG)
cargo build --release --no-features embeddings -p wingman-rag
```

See **[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)** → **Feature Flags** for details.

## Troubleshooting

### Build Issues

**Windows MSVC: `error LNK1318` (PDB cap exceeded)**

See `Cargo.toml` — already configured with `debug = "line-tables-only"` to stay under the 4GB limit.

**Tree-sitter compilation fails**

Tree-sitter requires a C toolchain. Install Visual Studio Build Tools (Windows) or gcc (Unix), or disable tree-sitter:
```bash
cargo build --release --no-default-features
```

### Runtime Issues

**"No such file or directory" errors**

Wingman expects absolute paths. Use `glob_tool` or `list_dir` to find files, then pass absolute paths to other tools.

**Permission errors**

Check your permission mode (`wingman config show | grep permission_mode`). Adjust in config.toml or pass `--mode auto-edit`.

**Token limit exceeded**

Compaction is triggered when history exceeds `tokens.compact_at_tokens` (default 120k). Older turns are summarized. See **[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)** → **Token Management**.

**Session embedding is slow**

Session embedding happens asynchronously after the session ends. This is normal on first run. Set `[learn] embed_sessions = false` in config to disable.

## Performance Tuning

- **Large codebases:** Increase `tokens.compact_at_tokens` and `tokens.tool_output_max_lines` so tool output isn't truncated too early.
- **Fast inference:** Use `router.fast_model = "anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5-20251001"` for quick tasks (Haiku is cheap and fast).
- **RAG indexing:** Set `rag.chunk_size = 500` (default) for larger chunks, or `200` for more granular search.
- **Disable RAG:** Set `rag.enabled = false` if you don't use `semantic_search`.
