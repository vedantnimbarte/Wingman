//! Pilot tools: the manager's orchestration tools, plus the worker-only
//! `run_acceptance` and `propose_tool`.
//!
//! The orchestration tools are the only ones on the manager's [`wingman_core::AgentLoop`].
//! Each is a thin Tool that translates JSON args from the model into a
//! [`crate::orchestrator::OrchestratorCommand`] and awaits the reply. Read-
//! only inspection tools (`list_dir`, `read_file`, `grep_tool`) come from
//! `wingman-tools::builtin` and are registered alongside these by
//! [`crate::manager::build_manager_registry`].

/// The manager's orchestration tools.
///
/// These are pollers and bookkeeping: the manager re-issues the same call each
/// tick until a worker changes the state it is asking about, so identical
/// repetition is normal operation rather than a loop. Named here so the
/// exemption cannot drift away from the set of tools it is about.
